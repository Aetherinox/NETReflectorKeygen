If you wish to view the source code, click the Github link above.

The keygen is free for anyone to use. I try to make stuff that isn't like the typical keygens out there. No loud annoying ass music, no ads, no weird color schemes that question if you're under the influence of shrooms.

Instructions should be pretty clear.
   - Generate a license key in keygen
   - Paste keygen into .NET Reflector App
   - Click "Activate Manually" in bottom right of .NET Reflector.
   - Copy all the text in the left-side box of .NET Reflector.
   - Paste copied text into left-side box of keygen.
   - Keygen will generate text in the right-side box.
   - Copy right-side box text in keygen.
   - Paste copied text into right-side box of .NET Reflector.
   - Click Finish
